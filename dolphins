<!-- all from the dolphins group slides. -->
         <li>Dolphins are carnivores (meat eaters).Fish, squid and crustaceans are included in their list of prey.</li>
         <li>Because dolphins are mammals, they need to come to the surface of the water to breathe.<li>
         the length of life depends on the type of dolphin.
         <li> Dolphins use a blowhole on top of their heads to breathe.
<li>
         Dolphins give birth to their young tail first. Theyâ€™re the only mammals known to do this.<li>orcas are a type of dolphins<li>Orcas have the second heaviest brain amongst marine animals<li>Spyhopping is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings.<li> An orca is not a whale.<li>How did the Killer Whale get its name? This is because it separates baby whales from their pods and eats them!<li>Surprisingly dolphins actually shed their skins, just like a snake. Wow. But it also helps to get rid of algae and bacteria that can cling to their skins.
<li>it is common for dolphin pods to care for their injured, old and sick members. There are even stories of dolphins coming to the aid of humans in dire time of need.
<li>some fishing methods, such as the use of nets, kill a large number of dolphins every year.
